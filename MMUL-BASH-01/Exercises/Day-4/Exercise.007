# Exercise 007 - Print an asterisk only for the variables set

1) Login into the machine with the credentials you own;

2) Touch a file called "variable_checklist.sh", change the mode in order to make
   it executable and add a bash interpreter line;

3) Add two variables in the script and name them VAR1 and VAR2, give them a
   value;

4) Add three lines that will print, as an alternate value for the first two
   lines if the var is set:

   1. VAR1: [*]
   2. VAR2: [*]

   And for the third line a custom error message stating: "VAR3 MUST BE SET!"

5) Execute the script and be sure not to remove it, it will be used in next
   exercise;
